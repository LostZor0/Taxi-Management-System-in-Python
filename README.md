# Taxi-Management-System-in-Python

There are two parts to this project. They are stored in their seperate branches.

The Taxi Management System is a Python-based project that leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to manage basic taxi operations. It includes functionalities like registering taxis, managing bookings, and tracking availability. All the data (e.g., taxi details, trip history) is stored directly in the code itself, without external databases. This project serves as a simplified prototype for managing a small taxi service, with focus on demonstrating OOP principles like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
